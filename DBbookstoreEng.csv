Walden recounts Thoreau's experiences over a two year, two month, and two day period in which he lived by himself in a cabin he built near Walden Pond, located in an isolated stretch of woodland outside Concord, Massachusetts. In Walden, Thoreau marries the physical with the transcendent -- intermixing precise scientific observations of the flora and fauna he encounters and changes in the pond itself with poetic and metaphorical musings on nature. A middling success in Thoreau's own life, Walden has proven to be an enduring classic and one of the most celebrated works of 19th century nonfiction literature.",11.37,72,3
